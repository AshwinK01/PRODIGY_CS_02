# PRODIGY_CS_02
Second task in prodigy
Here are some key features of the tool:
ðŸ”¹ Image Encryption and Decryption: The tool allows users to encrypt or decrypt images by adding or subtracting a key (an integer) to each pixel value. This simple yet effective method ensures that the original image is transformed into a coded format and can be reverted back to its original state.

ðŸ”¹ User Interaction: The program interacts with users through the console, asking them to choose whether they want to encrypt or decrypt an image, then prompting them to input the path to the image, the encryption key, and the path to save the output image.

ðŸ”¹ Handling Different Image Formats: The tool can process various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG), making it versatile for different use cases.

ðŸ”¹ Modular Design: The code is designed with modularity in mind, with separate functions for encryption (encrypt_image) and decryption (decrypt_image), facilitating easy maintenance and future enhancements.

ðŸ”¹ Practical Application: This project demonstrates the practical application of Python for image processing and cryptography, showcasing the ability to manipulate image data for secure storage and transmission.
